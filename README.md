## Scenario 

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of
marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your
team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team
will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve
your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## About Cyclistic 

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-sharing offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of **5,824** bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of **692** stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unloacked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. 

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

## The Business Task

The goal of this case study is to provide clear insights for designing marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. Towards this goal, I asked the following questions:

> 1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
> 2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
> 3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
